<h1>NB EHRs DL <small> Neuroblastoma Electronic Health Records Data Lake</small></h1>
<a href="https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/7185/neuroblastoma" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neuroblastoma</a> is a rare pedriatic cancer that affects thousands of children worldwide every year, and information stored in the electronic health records can be an useful source of data for scientific research studies about this disease. </br>
Several open datasets of electronic health records of anonymized patients diagnosed with neuroblastoma are available in the internet, but they were released on different websites and/or as supplementary information of peer-reviewed scientific publications, making them difficult to find. We therefore decided to create this Neuroblastoma Electronic Health Records Data Lake, a public free website containing all the open EHRs neuroblastoma datasets released online under open licenses such as the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0)</a> license.</br>
Having all these datasets in one place can bring several advantages to the scientific community. 
Scientific researchers and users, in fact, can take advantage of the listed datasets to carry on any scientific analyses they want. For example, they can apply computational statistics and machine learning methods to infer new knowledge about neuroblastoma.
